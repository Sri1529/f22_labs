# Login System (Next.js + Context API)

## Overview
This project is a simple login system built with **Next.js** that demonstrates:
- **Login** and **Logout** functionality.
- **LocalStorage** for storing and validating credentials.
- **Context API** for authentication state management.
- Preventing manual routing to protected pages without authentication.

   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup Environment Variables**  
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add:
   ```env

   ```

4. **Run the Project (Development Mode)** ðŸš€
